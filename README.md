# Username-and-Password-Gen
A small, basic script for username and password generation based on a user's legal name. 


# This generator is the result of CodeAcademy's last page in the "Strings" lesson, at the
# start of the second half of the "Learn Python 3" skill path. It was definitely a little bit
# harder than I think it really needed to be, and the hints weren't the most helpful. I felt
# a little stupid writing this script because I actually had to look at the solution code to
# see what exactly they were looking for. I didn't reuse their code, though, and as a result of
# that the program isn't as efficient as it could be, but I would rather lose efficiency than
# copy someone else's work. Working with the basics of string iteration wasn't that bad,
# but getting to the bits where you need to generate the password really brought me the most trouble.
# Username generation was the hardest bit, but now I know how to shift letters to the right,
# so everything's a learning experience.
